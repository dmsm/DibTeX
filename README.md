DibTeX
======

Second place finish in the advanced group at 5C Hackathon, Fall 2014.


DibTex is a LaTex submission system created to streamline and anonymize the grading process. Course professors can upload a solutions.tex file, which our django backend will take and strip the solution, posting it to students as an assignment. Students can then download this .tex or .pdf assignment, complete it, and submit a new .tex file. This submission file is broken down into unique problems, which are sent anonymously to graders along with the corresponding solution from the professor. The graders grade and comment on each problem, and then the system aggregates the grade and allows students to view the comments and grade, and for the professor to note the grade for each student.
